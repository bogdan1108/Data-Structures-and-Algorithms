Lab 1 - ADT Matrix – represented as a sparse matrix,using a dynamic array of triples <line,column,value> (value≠0), ordered lexicographically considering the <line,column> of every element.  
Lab 2 - ADT Map – using a SLL with (key,value) pairs.  
Lab 3 - ADT Sorted List (interface with TPozition = Iterator, SortedIteratedList) – using a DLLA where elements are ordered based on a relation.  
Lab 4 - ADT MultiMap – using a hashtable with coalesced chaining in which (key, value) pairs are stored. If a key has multiple values, it appears in multiple pairs.  
Lab 5 - ADT Sorted Bag – using a BST with linked representation on an array. In the BST (unique element, frequency) pairs are stored.
